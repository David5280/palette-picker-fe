## Summary

PALETTE! PICKER FE is an application for designers, color enthusiasts, and those who just need some help picking a color scheme for their next project.  For information on the PALETTE! PICKER back-end server, visit [PALETTE! PICKER BE](https://github.com/pgoulding/palette-picker-be).

This application provides the user with an unlimited amount of unique color palettes, five hexcodes at a time.  The user has the ability to lock certain colors they find appealing and continue generating new colors in the unlocked spaces.  Three options are given for color scheme, and six options are given for scheme variation to generate more predictable colors.  By clicking the "Create New Project!" button, a text input appears for the user enter a new project name, along with a save button directly below it to send it to the database for safe-keeping.  A dropdown menu directly to the right will display all saved projects in order to save new palettes to that project.  Palettes can be named before saving to a project.

When a user clicks the menu icon in the upper-left, they arrive at the projects page which displays all saved projects by their titles.  On this page, a user can visit each individual project, delete projects, or navigate back to the home page by clicking on the back arrow or application logo.  More options are available when visiting an individual project page, click on one of the project titles to see!

Each individual project page displays the title of the project up top and each palette saved to that project right below that.  A user can scroll through all of their saved palettes for easy comparison, and delete old palettes with the "X" icon next to that palette's title.  If one of the five colors isn't working out, a user can slick the randomize icon on that color to generate a new color, while keeping their four other beloved shades of happiness.  This new color can be saved by clicking the save icon that appears only when a new color has been generated.  

Both PALETTE! PICKER FE & BE were built in 11 days.
